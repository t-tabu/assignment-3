# discoveries

- The switches are responsible for the name
- The slider is responsible for the title 
- The switches and the slider are independent of eachother
    - (The configuration of the switches does not affect the title and the position of the slider does not affect the name)



## approaches

To begin I set both of the switches to the OFF position and set the slider to 0. After this i kept the switches in the OFF position and set the slider to 100, changing the title attached to the name. To confirm this i set the switch A to the ON position and kept switch B OFF. After generating I observed that the name changed, but the title remained the same. I repeated this process with switch "B" ON and switch "A" OFF and observed that the name changed again. Once again with both switches ON and the name had changed again. After determining the behaviour of the switches I moved on to the slider. Already observing that the slider in the position 0 has a unique title assigned to it i moved on to 1 which resulted in a change of title. Initially, i thought that each number from 0-100 had a unique title, but after moving the slider from 1-18 and seeing no change i determined that each title was assigned to a specific range of numbers. The range of which each title is assigned is mentioned in the Slider subheading.

### Switches

I determined that the switches affect the actual name assigned to the user.

If neither switch was set to the on position, the name assigned to me was "Lady val Flowers"

If the Switch "A" was set to the on position, but switch "B" was off. The name assigned to me was "Maester Harrod"

If the Switch "B" was set to the on positon, but the switch "A" was off. The name assigned was also "Maester Harrod"
    (I determined that the conditions for assigning me this name was if either of the switches are set to the on position, it would assign me the name)

If BOTH switches were set to the on positon. I was assigned the name "King Thoros"

From the behaviour i observed i came to the conclusion that the name assigned was dependent on the total number of switches set to the ON position. If 0 switches were set to ON -> Lady val Flowers. If 1 switch was set to ON -> Maester Harrod. If 2 Switches were set to ON -> King Thoros

### Slider

I determined that the slider affected the title that comes after the name.

I set the slider to 0 and the title assigned to me was "The Cruel"

I set the slider to 1 and the title assigned to me was "The Cursed"

    after seeing this behaviour i initially thought that there was a unique title for each number 0-100 but after setting the slider to 1-18 and observing no change in title i determined that each unique title was assigned to a range of numbers

after setting the slider to 20, the title assigned to me changed to "The Bloody"

This behaviour continues until 40 where the title is now changed to "The absurd"

The title remains as "The Absurd" until 100 where it is changed to "The Blessed"

The ranges for the titles are as follows
    
    0 = "The Cruel"

    1 - 18 = "The Cursed"

    19 - 39 = "The Bloody"

    40 - 99 = "The Absurd

    100 = "The Blessed"
